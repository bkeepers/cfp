# Why Our Code Smells

Odors are communication devices. They exist for a reason and are usually trying to tell us something. Our code smells and it is trying to tell us what is wrong.

I have been on a quest with a few coworkers to uncover why our code smells.  In this talk, I will walk through code from projects that I work on every day, looking for smells that indicate problems, understanding why it smells, what the smell is trying to tell us, and how to refactor it.
