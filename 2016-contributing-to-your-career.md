# Contributing to your career

Open source communities are made up of all kinds of people. Some are students, some are hobbyists, some work for startups, some work for large companies, some are technical prodigies, and most are just normal people like you and me. The one thing they all have in common is that contributing to open source has gained them the reputation of being among the best developers, designers, community managers, mentors, speakers, writers, and leaders in the world.

Not only is open source a great way to build software, it's a great way to learn, exercise your skills, and showcase your experience. This talk will explore ways of contributing to open source–through code and beyond–that can help advance your career and open up new opportunities.
