# Contributing to your career

## Abstract

Open source communities are made up of all kinds of people. Some are students, some are hobbyists, some work for startups, some work for large companies, some are technical prodigies, and most are just normal people like you and me. The one thing they all have in common is that contributing to open source has gained them the reputation of being among the best developers, designers, community managers, mentors, speakers, writers, and leaders in the world.

Not only is open source a great way to build software, it's a great way to learn, exercise your skills, and showcase your experience. This talk will explore ways of contributing to open source–through code and beyond–that can help advance your career and open up new opportunities.

## Intro

Some of the most successful people I know in software development have arrived where they are because their participation in open source helped them learn, gain experience, build a reputation, and get a good job.

So I asked them:

### “How has open source impacted your career?”

And I heard a _lot_ of responses like:

> “ I would not be a software engineer today if it weren't for open source.”

…and:

> “I believe my career opportunities have come from my contributions to open source with my interests and skills being public.”

…and…

> “Open source has expanded my network in a way I could not have done on my own.”

You hear people like Matthew Garret, a well-known Linux contributor, [saying](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/30420.html)

> “Without free software I'd have started years later. I'd have lost the opportunity to collaborate with people spread over the entire world. My first job would have looked very different, as would my entire career since then. Without free software, almost everything I've achieved in my adult life would have been impossible.”

Participating in open source will set you on path of continuously learning, building amazing things with amazing people, and finding great opportunities.

## The value of contributing

Participating in open source has incredible advantages, like…

- …working with and learning from some of the best developers in the world…
- …on interesting technology that gets used by hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people…
- …from wherever in the world you call "home"…
- …with free tools that you love or want to learn to love…
- …in communities with people that share your passions…
- …all for free.

Those alone are great reasons, 

this talk: take those for granted. Those are things you should do for you. Should always be finding ways to surrond yourself with great people, constantly learning.

Focus on something more superficial.

**What do Disney, Walmart, and John Deer have in common?** One is an "American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate" ([wikiepdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company), another is the largest retailer in the world, and the third makes tractors.

They're all software companies, and they all consume and contribute to open source software. They do other things too, but they are becoming primarily software companies. Them any every other company in the world, including:

> AirBnB. Amazon. AMD. Apple. Autodesk. Bloomberg. Bosch. Box. Broadcom. Capital One. Cisco. Citrix. Comcast. Craigslist. DellEMC. Disney. Dropbox. Ebay. Facebook. Ford. Fujitsu. GE. GitHub. Goldman Sachs. Google. Guardian. Home Depot. Honda. HP. IBM. Intel. J.P. Morgan. John Deere. Lenovo. LG. Mazda. Microsoft. NEC. Netflix. Nike. Nissan. Nokia. Nvidia. Oracle. Panasonic. PayPal. Pinterest. Qualcomm. Rackspace. RedHat. Salesforce. Samsung. SAP. Semantec. Sony. Square. Stripe. TMobile. Target. Toshiba. Toyota. Twitter. VMWare. Walmart. Western Digital. Yahoo.

Every company is becoming a software company, the future of their business depends on open source software. Which means, the future of their business relies on the people that contribute to open source software. They are all quickly realizing this. So, they want to hire people that have demonstrated experience with those technologies that can continue to evolve them.

**You can learn and use the tools that these companies depend on, and you can do it for free from wherever you are in the world.** 

Chris DiBona, head of the Open Source Programs Office at Google, says:

> Open source soft­ware is strate­gic to Google, and nat­u­rally we hire a great num­ber of open source devel­op­ers. Some­one who demon­strates their abil­ity by con­tribut­ing to open source projects shows that they are able to code in the real world in ways other devel­op­ers can not read­ily match. **_It’s the ulti­mate refer­ral._**

According to the [2016 Open Source Jobs Report](www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2016/05/2016-open-source-jobs-report-companies-hungry-professional-open), 87% of hiring managers say it’s hard to find
open source talent, and that "open source talent is one of the top priorities for recruitment this year." Basically, these companies want to throw money at you, but can’t find you.

It turns out, there's a secret patented formula to getting any job you want:

1. Learn skills and gain experience using those skills
2. Create public artifacts that demonstrate your skills
3. Make connections with people that need your skills and experience

Open source is an incredibly effective way to gain experience, build a reputation, and make connections.

## Becoming a contributor

The first step to becoming a contributor is realizing that open source is made by people like you.

> Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.
>
> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.
>
> – Steve Jobs

Seriously, think about this for a minute. Look around you right now. Pick up anything that is in reach and hold it in your hand. The display you're reading this on, whatever you're sitting on, the clothes you're wearing, the building that you're in. These were all made my people just like you. Someone first had the thought of making this thing. Maybe they sketched it out on paper, or told a friend about it. Maybe they put together a presentation and gave it to their team or their boss. Someone else saw that idea and offered feedback or a suggestion to improve it. Through hard work over time, that thing evolved into whatever it is today, thanks to people just like you.

[![Despite it being imaginary, I already have SUCH a strong opinion on the cord-switch firing incident.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/work.png)](https://xkcd.com/1741/)

Open source software is like that, except that _anyone_ can contribute. Some contributors are students, some are hobbyists, some work for startups, some work for large companies, some are technical prodigies, and most are just normal people like you and me.

Just remember, **It's ok to be new**. Every piece of open source software you use is made by people that we're once in your situation. Over time you'll likely suffer from "imposter syndrome". Unfortunately, that feeling doesn't go away. 

### Points of entry

There's not a "right" way to do it. There are as many paths to getting involved in open source as there are people in the world. Everyone's experience and background is unique.

Three paths that are becoming well-paved are:

1. Find a bug you have the skills to fix
2. Find a random project that is welcoming to newcomers
2. Contribute to a project you use

Many people are looking to get into open source by finding a random bug or project to contribute to. This approach has the benefit that many projects with a reputation for welcoming to new contributors have that reputation for a reason.

There's nothing wrong with finding a random project and making a contribution. This is a good way to find projects that are geared for beginners and give you a gentle introduction to open source without a lot at stake. The biggest downside is that you don’t have a lot invested in the outcome of the project, and will likely walk away when something comes up or you get busy.

Traditionally, most people have gotten involved in open source for more selfish reasons: they were using a project and they needed something from it. 

#### Contribute to a project you use

Grab something you can take notes with (laptop, phone, pen/paper).

1. Think about the latest software project you were working on.
2. Make a list of open source projects used by the project. Maybe you're using an open source language like Ruby, Python, or Swift. Maybe you're using some frontend JavaScript libraries, or a library that talks to an API, or a library that implements an algorithm. For example, the latest project I was working on is an app built with Node.js. It uses the express web framework, and npm modules that handle GitHub webhooks and talking to the GitHub API. It uses the `mocha` test framework, and the `xo` JavaScript linter. I was also using a project callled `pegjs`, a parser generator. I was editing it all with the Atom text editor, and installed an Atam package for syntax highlighting the pegjs grammar.
3. Now think about problems you ran into while using the open source projects. Make a list of some of those challenges. Maybe you had trouble installing or configuring one of them. Maybe you could figure out how to get it working in your unique situation. Maybe you ran into a weird error? Was there critical documentation that was missing? Did you discover any cleaver ways of improving the project?

Becoming an open source contributor is as easy as wanting more from the open source software you use, and the first step is to become an **active user**.

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/173/21066333/ac6e285a-be2a-11e6-9e95-7f173b5b2fda.png)

An active user wants something from the project, and gets it by constructively engaging the rest of the community of developers: reporting friction or bugs, giving feedback, or even just saying "thanks".

Most open source projects lose users from the "accumulation of non-events: someone visits a web site, downloads the software, tries to build it, fails, gives up and goes away." (Karl Fogel – [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/)).  Reporting your experience–good and bad–with a project is one of the most important first contributions you can make.

But becoming an active user is about more than just complaining. Take time to familiarize yourself with the project.

1. Browse the Code
1. Read the documentation
1. Browse open issues
1. Review open pull requests
1. Give feedback on feature discussions

Most importantly, "watch" the project on GitHub so you get emails when activity happens. You might not feel like you can contribute right now, but just give it time. Someday, an issue will come in that you know something about and you can help other users out.  Or a maintainer might ask for feedback, and you'll be there to give it to them.

Each contribution may seem insignificant, but they start to accrue. Without realizing it, you'll transition from user, to contributor, to committer.

Wanting more from the tools you depend on, and then solving your own problems builds skills and experience, and will eventually lead to opportunity.

## Building a reputation

Every day you are learning something new. new language, or tool, or trick, or life lesson…

Think about the last thing you learned. What evidence do you have to show for it?

As you are learning and gaining experience, form a habit of leaving a trail. **Create public artifacts** that demonstrate your skill and experience. It's a hard habit to form. There is temptation to wait until you’re expert, but by that point you will take your expertice for granted and have forgotten intricacies.

With everything that you do, ask yourself: “How can I create an artifact from this work?”

### Open source is more than code

As a project grows, more and more of the essential activity is not related to code.

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4483/11511691/2b11c3fa-9830-11e5-8721-91d1ef644940.png)

There are so many other ways to contribute to a project: design, reporting issues, documentation, community management, mentoring, organizing events, speaking at meetups.

Answer questions on Stack Overflow Write blog posts about how you solved a problem. Post on social media about your experience with a project.

Your online persona is your resumé. Be yourself…carefully. People are great at detecting self-promotion. Be authentic.

## Conclusion

Contributing to open source may not bring you fame or riches, but it will bring you experience, opportunity, and fulfillment.

Even if you're not looking for it, opportunity will fly by you.
