Brandon Keepers is a developer at GitHub, where he spends most days orchestrating Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and whatever else is needed to ship a great product. Brandon began his professional career in 2002 at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, designing websites, writing PHP and Java, and wrangling servers. In 2006, he co-founded Collective Idea where he contracted for a wide variety clients and led training all over the world. Brandon then joined Ordered List, where he helped build SpeakerDeck.com, Gaug.es, and HarmonyApp.com, all of which were acquired by GitHub in 2011.

When his face is not dimly lit by a computer screen, you can find him enjoying good food and drink with his wife, lounging with a book in his hands in Holland, Michigan, or running with his dog. He shares about his endeavors on twitter as @bkeepers and on his blog at opensoul.org.
