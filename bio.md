Brandon Keepers is a maker and breaker of things at GitHub working mostly on [Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com). When his face is not dimly lit by a computer screen, you can find him with a book in his hands, playing racquetball or basketball, running with his dog, or enjoying good food and drink with his wife. He shares about his endeavors at [@bkeepers](http://twitter.com/bkeepers) and opensoul.org.
