Brandon Keepers is a developer at GitHub, where he spends most days orchestrating Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and whatever else is needed to ship a great product. When his face is not dimly lit by a computer screen, you can find him enjoying good food and drink with his wife and friends, lounging with a book in his hands in Holland, Michigan, or running with his dog.
