# JavaScript Adolescence

At 16 years old, JavaScript is full of hormones and ready to take on the world. It's voice has finally stopped cracking, the acne is starting to clear up, and it's gangly feet finally grew into the prototypal shoes.

In this talk, I will explore the ways in which JavaScript still has some growing up to do. From the lack of coding conventions, to the absence or immaturity of application frameworks, writing large applications in JavaScript is awkward. Programmers still treat JavaScript like a child by ignoring or improperly applying design patterns and avoiding testing.

This talk will contain code examples taken from real applications.

## Notes

* coding conventions
* practice safe-coding (testing)
* application framework
* organize large-scale applications
