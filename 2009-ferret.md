# Taming the Ferret

Watch out, he bites! The Ruby port of the Lucene search engine has earned a reputation. While this furry little guy can be a sensitive animal, with proper care and feeding, Ferret can be an amazing asset. Come learn how to add full-text searching to your Rails application without getting bit.

## Abstract

Ferret is a Ruby port of Lucene, the Java-base search engine. Over the years it has gotten a bad rap. It's a sensitive animal, but with proper care and feeding, Ferret can be an amazing asset.

In this talk, I will walk the audience through configuring and using Ferret to power full-text searching in a real-world Rails application, from installing the Ferret gem, to the Rails plugin that makes life easier, to deciding what to index and how to index it. We will also explore the common pitfalls that give Ferret a bad name and learn how to avoid them.

Ferret is not the only solution for full-text searching in a Rails application.  We will compare Ferret to some of the alternatives like Sphinx, learning about the advantages and disadvantages in different situations.

The audience will leave this talk with a strong grasp of the strengths and weaknesses of Ferret, be empowered to add full-text searching to their own applications and will be prepared to handle Ferret in a production environment.
