# Git: The NoSQL Database

We all know that Git is amazing for storing code. It is fast, reliable, flexible, and it keeps our project history nuzzled safely in its object database while we sleep soundly at night.

But what about storing more than code? Why not data? Much flexibility is gained by ditching traditional databases, but at what cost?

In this talk, I will explore the idea of using Git as a data store. I will look at the benefits of using a schema-less data store, the incredible opportunity opened up by having every change to every model versioned, and the crazy things that could be done with branching and merging changes to data.

I will also explore the challenges posed by using and scaling Git as a data store, including concurrent access and distributing load.
