#Building Rails plugins

Rails does a lot, but there are infinitely more things it shouldn't and doesn’t do. The solution? Plugins. Whether you have a Rails-core enhancement you want to prototype, a pattern you want to extract, or functionality you want to reuse, its time to write a plugin.

Plugins range from simple view helpers to meta-programmed ActiveRecord additions, and anyone can write them. At first glance, writing plugins can seem difficult and confusing. But you just need to know where and how to begin… and don’t forget tests! Testing plugins can be easy and save a lot of development time.

This talk will equip developers to build their own Rails plugins; examining just what it is about Ruby that makes Rails’ plugins so powerful. It will look at the conventions used in building plugins and explore some of the challenges, like testing and database migrations, that developers face when building Rails plugins.
