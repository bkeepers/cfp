Many of GitHub's products, tools and infrastructure are built with Ruby. We love Ruby.

In this talk, we will look at the libraries, practices and conventions that GitHub uses with Ruby. We will survey all of the repositories maintained by GitHub to get insight into how Ruby is used. We will also examine some of the areas where we opt to not use Ruby.
