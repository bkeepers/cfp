# Ruby at GitHub

GitHub loves Ruby. Many of our products, tools and infrastructure are built with Ruby.

In this talk, we will look at the libraries, practices and conventions that GitHub uses with Ruby. We will survey all of the repositories maintained by GitHub to get insight into how it is used, and we will also examine some of the areas where we opt to not use Ruby.

## Topics

* % of each language across all internal projects
* [Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
* Libraries/Gems
* Sinatra <=> Rails
* Testing rameworks
* code/test ratio
* Where we don't use Ruby (native apps, gitrpc, bert/ernie)
